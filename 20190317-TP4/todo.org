#+TITLE: TODO-list for TP4 project : Handling books

* Data structures

An import class with a BufferedReader which reads a csv file.  The
path is hard written (at the moment)


* TODO-List :

** TODO Rewrite the import class :
*** a method for managing the csv file
*** a method for trimming the first line (fields)
*** a method for returning the file in an arraylist/or 2D String array
*** a method for returning the fields within the array giving a specific book
*** a method for returning the fields of a random book

** TODO Rewrite the import class with a correct structure (instance variables, constructor, protected stuff etc.)
